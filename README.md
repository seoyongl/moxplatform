# moxplatform

Platform-specific code for Moxxy. Not intended for use outside of Moxxy.

This repo is based on [very_good_flutter_plugin](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_flutter_plugin).

## Development

The development of this package is based on [melos](https://pub.dev/packages/melos).

To make all packages link to each other locally, begin by running `melos bootstrap`. After editing
the code and making your changes, please run `melos run analyze` to make sure that no linter warnings
are left inside the code.
